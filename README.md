# The app's features

The following features are available in this app:

* Enter a book title, author, date started and pages read and click 'create' to enter a new book to the table.
* Ability to edit/update the amount of pages read to keep better track. 
* Ability to save and delete entries.

# Tools and techniques used 

This application mainly utilized table making techniques in Javascript. 

These functions were written using three primary methods:  
1. Map
2. Filter
3. Sort

  Basic HTML was used and classes were added for DOM manipulation using documentQuerySelector.    

  The styling was added using simple CSS properties with some additional flexbox features for layout.  

  None of these tools were new to me as we have excellent instructors that walked us through each of these methods on previous assignments.   

# Where the app is hosted.  
No need to download this application. It is currently being hosted at https://hurl2526.github.io/todata/ for anyone to use!
